## Current Projects
While we are always working on a number of projects for the company, our primary focus is actively developing and maintaining  [Magpie](Active Projects/Magpie/getting-started.md). 

[Magpie](Active Projects/Magpie/getting-started.md) performs cloud service discovery, non-native data store fingerprinting and cloud security configuration analysis, a set of capabilities generally referred to as Cloud Security Posture Management or CSPM. Magpie is going beyond CSPM to provide an extensible discovery engine and flexible security rules engine suitable for the modern threat landscape like cloud ransomware and cloud supply chain security issues.

We have extracted the remediation guidance from the [https://github.com/openraven/security-rules](https://github.com/openraven/security-rules) into [cloud confguration guides](Cloud Configuration Guides/guides.md) for AWS and GCP. 

We also develop and maintain [MockingBird](https://github.com/openraven/mockingbird), a data generation tool to create data sets for testing data classification tools.
