# Projects
While we are always working on a number of projects for the company, our primary focus is actively developing and maintaining  [Magpie](Active Projects/Magpie/getting-started.md). 

[Magpie](Active Projects/Magpie/getting-started.md) performs cloud service discovery, non-native data store discovery and cloud security configuration analysis, a set of capabilities generally referred to as Cloud Security Posture Management or CSPM. [Magpie](Active Projects/Magpie/getting-started.md) is going beyond CSPM to provide a scalable discovery engine and flexible security rules engine suitable for the modern threat landscape like cloud ransomware and cloud supply chain security issues.

We also develop and maintain [MockingBird](Active Projects/Mockingbird/getting-started.md) , a data generation tool to create data sets for testing data classification tools as well as a set of Cloud Security Configuration Guides that explain how to fix security issues in both [Amazon Web Services]() and [Google Cloud Platform]().
