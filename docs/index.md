## Introduction 
This is the technical documentation site for our open source projects.  

You can find out more about the research team at [https://openraven.com/research](https://www.openraven.com/research) where you will also find additional tutorials, research papers and other technical material. We run an open [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/open-raven-research/shared_invite/zt-np27xiev-N5rL4AcTmrQt8YkE81BIaw) to provide updates on work, ask questions and share ideas.

All code for these projects can be found at [https://github.com/openraven](https://github.com/openraven) where we release all open source code under an [Apache 2.0 license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/).

## Core Projects
### Magpie
Magpie is a cloud security analysis tool that is going beyond traditional CSPM. Written in Java and architected to be deployed and operate at scale, Magpie will discover the services running in your cloud accounts and then run security configuration checks against security best practices and against compliance standards like the CIS Benchmarks and the PCI DSS. The focused of attention in Magpie development is going "beyond CSPM", meaning advancing into advanced attack pattern modelling that we beleive more accurately represents todays threat landscape. Magpie supports AWS and GCP. 

The Magpie repo is [https://github.com/openraven/magpie](https://github.com/openraven/magpie). 

The security rules repo is [https://github.com/openraven/security-rules](https://github.com/openraven/security-rules).

Remediation advice can be found in our [Cloud Security Configuration Guide](Cloud Configuration Guides/guides.md).
