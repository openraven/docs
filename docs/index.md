## Introduction 
This is the technical documentation site for our open source projects.  

You can find out more about the team at [https://openraven.com/research](https://www.openraven.com/research) where there are additional tutorials, and security research papers.

We run an open [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/open-raven-research/shared_invite/zt-np27xiev-N5rL4AcTmrQt8YkE81BIaw) where you can to track our work, ask questions and share your ideas.

We release all code at [https://github.com/openraven](https://github.com/openraven) and release our projects under an [Apache 2.0 license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/).

## Projects
While we are always working on a number of software ideas for the company that may or may not become open-source projects, our primary project that is actively developed and maintained is [Magpie](Projects/Magpie/getting-started.md).

Magpie is the open source core of our commercial product that performs cloud service discovery, non-native data store discovery and cloud security configuration analysis. This is generally referred to as Cloud Security Posture Management or CSPM, although Magpie is going beyond CSPM and configuration analysis to provide a discovery engine and security rules engine suitable for the modern threat landscape like cloud ransomware and supply chain issues. 

We also maintain a set of Cloud Security Configuration Guides that explain how to fix security issues that have been identified by [Magpie](Projects/Magpie/getting-started.md).

## How to Contribute
We encourage and welcome [community contributions](Developer Docs/contribution-guide.md) to our projects and [documentation](https://github.com/openraven/docs). We do maintain a [community code of conduct](Developer Docs/welcome.md).
You can read about our security practices in our [security policy](Developer Docs/security.md).
