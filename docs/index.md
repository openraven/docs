## Introduction 
This is the technical documentation site for our open source projects.  

You can find out more about the team at [https://openraven.com/research](https://www.openraven.com/research) where there are additional tutorials and original security research papers.

We run an open [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/open-raven-research/shared_invite/zt-np27xiev-N5rL4AcTmrQt8YkE81BIaw) where you can to track our work, ask questions and share your ideas.

We release all code at [https://github.com/openraven](https://github.com/openraven) under an [Apache 2.0 license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/).

## Projects
While we are always working on a number of software ideas for the company that may or may not become open source projects, our primary project that is actively developed and maintained by a team of dedicated full-time developers is [Magpie](Projects/Magpie/getting-started.md). 

[Magpie](Projects/Magpie/getting-started.md) performs cloud service discovery, non-native data store discovery and cloud security configuration analysis, a set of capabilities generally referred to as Cloud Security Posture Management or CSPM, however [Magpie](Projects/Magpie/getting-started.md) is going beyond CSPM to provide a scalable discovery engine and flexible security rules engine suitable for the modern threat landscape like cloud and data ransomware and cloud and data supply chain security issues.

[MockingBird](Projects/Mockingbird/getting-started.md) 

We also maintain a set of Cloud Security Configuration Guides that explain how to fix security issues in both [Amazon Web Services]() and [Google Cloud Platform]() that have been identified by [Magpie](Projects/Magpie/getting-started.md).

## How to Contribute
We encourage and welcome [community contributions](Developer Docs/contribution-guide.md) to our projects and [documentation](https://github.com/openraven/docs). We do maintain a [community code of conduct](Developer Docs/welcome.md).
You can read about our security practices in our [security policy](Developer Docs/security.md).
