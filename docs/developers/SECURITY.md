# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please ensure that you are always running the latest release version for all projects. We do not back port bugs or vulnerability fixes.         |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

All security vulnerabilities should be reported via email to opensource@openraven.com. Please do not submit vulnerabilities as issues. We will look and respond via email to all vulnerability reports as soon as practical (usually within 48 hours) and act on all issues we deem as needing attention. 

We do not run a bug bounty program.
