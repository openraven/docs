As part of the [Magpie](../Active%20Projects/) project, we maintain a set of security configuration guides to help engineers remediate potential issues that have been found.

There are currently two guides, both with content organized around a common [multi-cloud taxonomy](cloud-taxonomy.md) that our security rules also follow.

[AWS Security Configuration Guide](aws.md)


[GCP Security Configuration Guide](gcp.md)
