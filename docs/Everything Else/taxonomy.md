This is the cloud taxonomy, adopted from [https://comparecloud.in](https://comparecloud.in) that we use across our open-source projects and documentation. We use this taxonomy to name and group Magpie security rules and to organize associated configuration guidance. 

The mapping of which [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) services map to which category can be found on [https://comparecloud.in](https://comparecloud.in) and in the open-source Github repo [https://github.com/ilyas-it83/CloudComparer/](https://github.com/ilyas-it83/CloudComparer/)
