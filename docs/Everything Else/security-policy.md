We take security seriously, we are first and foremost a security company. Like any software ours may have security issues. We take proactive steps to avoid issues such as having security savvy developers, reviewing all pull-requests and running security tools. 

Please ensure that you are always running the latest release version for all projects as we do not back port bugs or vulnerability fixes.

All security vulnerabilities should be reported via email to [opensource@openraven.com](mailto:opensource@openraven.com). Please do not submit vulnerabilities as Github issues. We will look and respond via email to all vulnerability reports as soon as practical (usually within 24 hours) and act on all issues we deem as needing attention. We do not run a bug bounty program but will send some fancy swag and publicly acknowledge researchers that report bugs.
