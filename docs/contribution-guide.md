We welcome all contributions to our open source tools including feedback, bug reports and pull-requests. 

You should first take a look at the current team [backlog}(https://github.com/openraven/magpie/issues). Our backlog is where you can learn about all the tools and features we're working on, features we are planning , what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. It is also where you should report issues and feature requests. 

## Reporting Issues

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability, and instead to refer to our security policy below. 

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under Issues for the project itself.
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring if possible. 

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing](contribution-guide.md) guide to learn about our contribution policy.
#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**
* Suggest your change in the [Slack workspace) and just start writing code.
#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**
* Ask any question about how to use a project on the Slack workspace.
