# Open Source at Open Raven
This is the main README for open source projects at [Open Raven](https://www.openraven.com/research). The majority of the engineering here is done by our Research team, a full-time research and development team that focuses on cloud and data security. 

We run a [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/open-raven-research/shared_invite/zt-np27xiev-N5rL4AcTmrQt8YkE81BIaw) that is open to everyone to discuss, ask questions or share ideas.



## Flagship Project - Magpie
Our flagship project is Magpie, a cloud security analysis tool that is going beyond traditional CSPM into mapping extended surfaces areas like Kuberbernetes and using complex rules beyond compliance checks. You can find the Magpie repo [here](https://github.com/openraven/magpie)
